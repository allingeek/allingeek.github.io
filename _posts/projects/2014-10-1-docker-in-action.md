In the fall of 2014 I was approached to write a book on Docker by Manning Publications Co. I took the opportunity. I’ve written the first three chapters and released them through the Manning Early Access Program (MEAP). This program gets the material to the readers before publication. So that they can benefit from it, and the author can benefit from their feedback. MEAPs make books better. I’m proud to have the opportunity to help people get to know Docker, containers, and really the whole container ecosystem.
